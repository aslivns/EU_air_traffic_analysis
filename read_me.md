IRONHACK Data Analytics Mid-bootcamp Project

This project is about EU passenger air traffic between 2010-2021 and first half of 2022

Dataset: - Eurostat - https://commission.europa.eu/index_en
         - Dataset includes records of airports in 27 EU countries
         - UK is not included in this analysis (before 2020)
         - Measurement is arrival-departure flights by each airport, which causes duplications
            Ex: Passengers flying from Amsterdam to Athens are counted in AMS airport as ‘departure’ and after their landing they are counted             in ATH airport as ‘arrival’
